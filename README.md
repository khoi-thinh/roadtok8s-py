# Kubernetes Playground

This is a playground project following the book **"The Road to Kubernetes"**. The goal is to get hands-on experience in deploying and managing applications using Kubernetes.

## Setup Overview

Instead of using **AKAMAI**, this project leverages **AWS EC2** and **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters.

## Key Changes:
- **AWS EC2** is used instead of AKAMAI for provisioning servers.
- **Amazon EKS** is used to manage Kubernetes clusters instead of the default tools mentioned in the book.

## Tools Used:
- AWS EC2
- Amazon EKS
- Docker
- kubectl
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
